    <p>“A pamphlet, no matter how good, is never read more than once, but a song is learned by heart and repeated over
        and over; I maintain that if a person can put a few cold, common sense facts into a song, and dress them up in a
        cloak of humor to take the dryness off of them, he will succeed in reaching a great number of workers who are
        too unintelligent or too indifferent to read a pamphlet or an editorial on economic science.” —Joe Hill</p>

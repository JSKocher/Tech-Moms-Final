    <p>A songwriter, laborer, and union organizer, Joe Hill became famous around the world after a Utah
        court convicted him of murder. Historians have since all but cleared Hill’s name, but a number of
        factors, including a hard-headed judge, a bungled legal defense, and widespread anti-union
        sentiment at the time contributed to his execution. Unfortunately, this was not an uncommon fate for
        the early leaders of America’s labor movement.</p>
    <p>Before the international campaign to have his conviction reversed, however, Joe Hill was well known
        on picket lines and at workers' rallies as the author of popular labor songs and as a labor union
        organizer. Thanks in large part to his songs and to his stirring, well-publicized call to his fellow
        workers on the eve of his execution—"Don't waste time mourning, organize!"—Hill became, and he
        has remained, the best-known martyr and folk hero of the labor movement.</p>
    <p>The works of Joe Hill are still widely celebrated today. Songwriters such as Joan Baez, Bob Dylan,
        Pete Seeger, Paul Robeson, Woody Guthrie, Utah Phillips and Billy Bragg have all been inspired by
        the works of Joe Hill. The work of Joe Hill has become so ingrained in American culture that we use
        sayings like “pie in the sky” without even knowing that is one of his song lyrics. His works are still
        routinely covered by contemporary artists and can be heard sung with great pride at union halls.</p>

    <p>Joe Hill is perhaps best known through his involvement in the labor movement in the United States. His musical
        talents famously spread throughout the labor community and led to his prominence within their ranks. Sadly,
        after being accused of the murder of a local Salt Lake City grocer and subsequently suffering through an unjust
        trial, Hill was executed by firing squad at the old Utah State Prison, which once stood within the borders of
        the current Sugar House Park. Hill was so beloved within the labor movement and the Nation at large, that tales
        of his incarceration and trial quickly spread, leading figures like President Woodrow Wilson and Helen Keller
        calling for clemency.
        Given this past history, the erection of a monument to honor Joe Hill would serve as an apt reminder of the
        miscarriage of justice which occured with his case and help fortify our resolve as a community to do better.
        Additionally, many will see the monument as a recognition of immigrants like Joe, countless of whom worked by
        the sweat of their brow to help build Utah into the flourishing State it is today.
        By establishing a monument memorializing Joe Hill, Sugar House Park will not only recognize an important piece
        of history, but also continue to bolster its reputation as the preeminant park and historical gathering place in
        the Salt Lake Valley.

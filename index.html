        world renowned Labor figure and musician. A Swedish immigrant who worked as a laborer
        around the West and became a famed songwriter for the IWW knows as "The Wobblies". It's very important to
        recognize
        the
        historical significance and foundational efforts of America's early Labor movement of which Hill was a leader.
        The
        American labor movement has played a massive role in shaping our society. Joe hill has become an iconic figure
        in
        the state of Utah with the state now looking to document historical records surrounding his execution in 1915.
